# Rainy Rain Sounds

I like to listen to rain while I work/commute, but I hate ads. So I built my own open source app.

## Features

* Infinite rain loop
* Optional thunder sounds
* [TODO] Optional church bells to notify you of the time

## Sound Licenses
* calpo_rain.ogg: I recorded myself, released under CC0.
* All thunders have been extracted from [this](https://opengameart.org/content/thunder-lightning-ambience-field-recording) audio track created by Gregor Quendel
* Chuch bell is from: https://www.zapsplat.com/music/distant-church-bell-tolling-chiming-1-time/
